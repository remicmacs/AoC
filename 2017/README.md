# Advent of code

This repository has the sole purpose to store my solutions to the [Advent of
code 2017](https://adventofcode.com/).

I do not own Advent of Code, and I don't recommend using my solutions, I just
want to store the problems and the solutions I designed somewhere, so I will
be able to find that intel when I need it in the future.

Feel free to suggest any improvement of my solutions, I'm a student eager to
learn. However I do not promise to have the time to respond to all - if any -
requests.

Thanks for reading and merry holidays!
